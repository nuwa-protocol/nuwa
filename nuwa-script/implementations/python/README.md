# NuwaScript - Python Implementation

This directory contains the Python implementation of the NuwaScript interpreter. NuwaScript is a lightweight, structured scripting language designed for AI Agents to define executable logic and actions.

## ‚ú® Features

This implementation currently supports the following NuwaScript features:

*   **Variable Assignment**: `LET variable = expression`
*   **Tool Invocation**: `CALL tool_name { arg1: value1, ... }` (both as statements and expressions within `LET`)
*   **Conditional Logic**: `IF condition THEN ... END` and `IF condition THEN ... ELSE ... END`
*   **Iteration**: `FOR element IN list_variable DO ... END` (currently iterates over Python lists)
*   **Expression Evaluation**:
    *   Literals: Numbers (int, float), Strings, Booleans (`true`, `false`)
    *   Variables
    *   Binary Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `AND`, `OR`
    *   Unary Operators: `NOT`
    *   Parentheses for grouping: `(expression)`
    *   Basic Member Access: `variable.member` (parsed, assumes `variable` evaluates to a dict)
*   **Built-in Functions**: `NOW()` (returns current Unix timestamp)
*   **Calculation Block**: `CALC { formula: "...", vars: {...} }` (uses `eval()` - **currently unsafe!**)
*   **Comments**: Single-line comments starting with `//`

## üì¶ Installation

It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment (`venv`) to manage dependencies for this project.

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rooch-network/nuwa.git # Or your repo URL
    cd nuwa/nuwa-script/implementations/python
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    # Create the environment (e.g., named 'venv')
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the environment
    # On macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows (cmd.exe):
    # venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat
    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    # venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
    ```
    You should see `(venv)` prepended to your command prompt after activation.

3.  **Install dependencies within the activated environment**:
    Use `pip` to install the package and its dependencies.

    For regular use:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
    For development (including test dependencies like `pytest`). Use quotes around `.[dev]` if your shell (like zsh) requires it:
    ```bash
    pip install -e '.[dev]'
    ```

4.  **Deactivate** (when you are finished):
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

Here's how to use the interpreter:

```python
from nuwa.parser import parse_script
from nuwa.interpreter import Interpreter, InterpreterError
from nuwa.tools import ToolRegistry, ToolExecutionError, ToolNotFoundException

# 1. Define your NuwaScript
script_content = """
LET user_id = "user-123"
LET user_info = CALL get_user_details { id: user_id }

IF user_info.is_active == true THEN
    CALL send_notification { user: user_id, message: "Welcome back!" }
ELSE
    CALL log_event { event: "inactive_user_login", user: user_id }
END

LET current_timestamp = NOW()
"""

# 2. (Optional) Define and register tools
class MyToolRegistry(ToolRegistry):
    def get_user_details(self, id: str) -> dict:
        print(f"[Tool] Getting details for {id}")
        # Replace with actual logic (e.g., API call)
        if id == "user-123":
            return {"name": "Alice", "is_active": True}
        return {"name": "Unknown", "is_active": False}

    def send_notification(self, user: str, message: str) -> bool:
        print(f"[Tool] Sending to {user}: {message}")
        return True # Simulate success

    def log_event(self, event: str, user: str):
        print(f"[Tool] Logging event '{event}' for user {user}")
        # No return value needed

# Create and populate the registry
registry = MyToolRegistry()
registry.register("get_user_details", registry.get_user_details)
registry.register("send_notification", registry.send_notification)
registry.register("log_event", registry.log_event)


# 3. Parse the script
print("Parsing script...")
ast = parse_script(script_content)

if ast:
    print("Script parsed successfully.")
    # 4. Create an interpreter instance (with tools)
    interpreter = Interpreter(tool_registry=registry)

    # 5. Execute the script
    try:
        print("Executing script...")
        interpreter.execute(ast)
        print("\nExecution finished.")
        print("Final variables:", interpreter.variables)
    except (InterpreterError, ToolNotFoundException, ToolExecutionError) as e:
        print(f"\nRuntime Error: {e}")
else:
    print("Script parsing failed.")

```

## ‚úÖ Testing

Make sure you are inside the activated virtual environment where you installed the development dependencies.

To run the unit tests, navigate to the `nuwa-script/implementations/python` directory and run `pytest`:

```bash
# Ensure your virtual environment is active
# (venv) ... $
cd nuwa-script/implementations/python
pytest
```

Make sure you have installed the development dependencies (`pip install -e '.[dev]'`)

## üöß Limitations & Future Work

This implementation is currently under development and has several limitations:

*   **Unsafe `CALC`**: Uses Python's `eval()` which is **not safe** for untrusted input. This needs to be replaced with a secure math expression evaluator (e.g., `simpleeval`).
*   **Global Scope Only**: All variables share a single global scope. Proper block-level scoping (for `IF`, `FOR`) is not yet implemented.
*   **Basic Error Reporting**: Syntax and runtime errors provide basic messages but lack precise line/column information in many cases.
*   **Limited Built-ins**: Only `NOW()` is implemented. More functions (e.g., string manipulation, math functions) could be added.
*   **Limited Operators**: Only core logical and comparison operators are supported. Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and string concatenation currently require `CALC`.
*   **Basic Member Access**: `variable.member` assumes the base variable holds a dictionary. Deeper access (`a.b.c`) or attribute access on objects is not directly supported by the interpreter logic yet.
*   **No Type System**: No static or runtime type checking beyond basic Python type compatibility during operations.
*   **No Security Sandboxing**: Lacks execution limits (time, memory, loop iterations).

Future work could include addressing these limitations, adding support for script imports/modules, and improving overall robustness and performance.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

*   **`SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` during `pip install`**:
    *   This error indicates that `pip` cannot verify the SSL certificate of PyPI (pypi.org), often due to network proxy/firewall configurations or outdated system root certificates.
    *   **Try updating certificates**: `pip install --upgrade certifi` within your activated `venv`.
    *   **(macOS)** If you installed Python via the official installer from python.org, run the `Install Certificates.command` script in your `/Applications/Python X.Y` folder.
    *   **Temporary Workaround (Use with caution)**: You can temporarily tell `pip` to trust the PyPI hosts. This bypasses the security check:
        ```bash
        pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org -e '.[dev]'
        ```
        It's better to resolve the underlying certificate issue if possible, especially for production environments.

*   **`AssertionError: Multiple .egg-info directories found` during `pip install -e`**:
    *   This usually means previous build attempts left conflicting metadata directories.
    *   **Solution**: Clean up build artifacts from the `nuwa-script/implementations/python` directory:
        ```bash
        rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info/
        ```
    *   Then try the `pip install -e '.[dev]'` command again.
