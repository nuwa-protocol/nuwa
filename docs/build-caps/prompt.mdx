## Prompt Basics

The Cap prompt is the system instruction the client uses to start conversations. Keep it concise and explicit about the tool's role and boundaries.

```ts
core: {
  prompt: {
    value: 'You are a helpful travel planner. Today the user is in {{user_geo}}. Always ask one clarifying question.',
    suggestions: [
      'Plan a 3-day trip to Osaka',
      'Find kid-friendly activities near me',
    ],
  }
}
```

### Variables

The Nuwa Client resolves simple variables before sending the prompt to the model.

- `{{user_geo}}`: user location heuristics (geolocation if permitted; otherwise timezone hint)

Variables are intentionally minimal; prefer MCP tools for dynamic context (calendars, files, etc.).

## Tips

- Give examples of desired inputs and outputs
- Declare safety limits and escalation rules
- Keep the first sentence crisp - it affects model behavior disproportionately
