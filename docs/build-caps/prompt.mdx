description: "Set the Prompt for your Cap"
---

The prompt in a Cap is loaded as the system prompt sent to the model when the user uses your Cap in the Nuwa Client. You can set it as part of the Cap config.

```ts cap.json
core: {
  prompt: {
    value: 'You are a helpful travel planner. Today the user is in {{user_geo}}. Always ask one clarifying question.',
    suggestions: [ // the optional conversation opener for your Cap
      'Plan a 3-day trip to Osaka',
      'Find kid-friendly activities near me',
    ],
  }
}
```

### Prompt Variables
You can set some prompt variables in the prompt value. The Nuwa Client resolves these variables with actual value before sending the request to the model. For example:

- `{{user_geo}}`: user location heuristics (geolocation if permitted; otherwise timezone hint)
- `{{artifact_selections}}`: the current selections from the artifact

You can find all the available prompt variables in the [Cap Studio](https://test-app.nuwa.dev/cap-studio).

<Tip>Variables are intentionally minimal; use MCP tools for dynamic context (calendars, files, etc.).</Tip>
