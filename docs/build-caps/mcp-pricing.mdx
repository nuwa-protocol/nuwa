With either Nuwa MCP Proxy or a direct Nuwa-Compatible MCP server, you will be setting a fixed per-call price for each MCP tool via the `pricePicoUSD` field.

The unit price is [Pico](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/si-prefixes?utm_source=chatgpt.com) USD, which is 1/1,000,000,000,000 USD (1e-12).

Here's a simple converter to help you convert between USD and PicoUSD:


import { PicoUsdConverter } from '/snippets/PicoUsdConverter.jsx';
