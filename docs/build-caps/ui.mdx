## What You Can Build

Add a web UI that runs inside the Nuwa Client (iframe) to:

- Guide users through multi‑step workflows with forms and controls
- Visualize results (tables, charts, maps) alongside chat
- Collect structured input and add selections back to the thread
- Stream AI output directly into your UI
- Persist UI state across sessions; adapt to client theme

Implementation uses `@nuwa-ai/ui-kit`. Details live in the two pages below; this is only a high‑level overview.

## Two UI Types

1) Artifact UI
- A dedicated, persistent panel for your Cap
- Great for editors, dashboards, notebooks, or long‑lived tasks
- Configure once in your Cap (artifact.srcUrl), then your UI talks to the client
- Tools can also open artifact views by returning a UI resource that targets the artifact area

2) MCP UI
- On‑demand views opened by tool results
- A tool can return a UI resource (capui:/path) to render a specific route in your UI
- Your iframe can host an MCP server (postMessage) so AI can call into your UI logic
- Ideal for AI‑driven wizards, inspectors, or side panels tied to a tool run

## Choosing Between Them

- Pick Artifact UI when you want a stable workspace that users revisit and drive directly.
- Pick MCP UI when views are tied to specific tool executions or AI‑driven subflows.
- Combine both: keep a primary artifact panel and still return targeted views from tools.

## What You Need

- A hosted UI origin (HTTPS) that the client can load
- For Artifact UI: set core.artifact.srcUrl in your Cap
- For MCP UI: have tools return UI resources (capui:/path) and optionally run an MCP server inside the iframe
