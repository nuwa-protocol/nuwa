## Overview

This guide shows how to launch your first Cap using the Nuwa Client (Beta), configure its Model, Prompt, and MCP servers, and publish it to the Cap Store.

<Tip>
  For a deeper dive into how Caps work, see Core Concepts -> Capabilities and the Build Caps section.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Sign in and enable Cap Studio

1) Go to the Nuwa Client Beta: https://test-app.nuwa.dev/
2) Create and authenticate your DID with your device passkey
3) Go to Settings -> System -> Enable Developer Mode
4) You will see Cap Studio in the sidebar

## Step 2: Create a Cap

Once you are in the Cap Studio, there are two ways to start creating a Cap:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Online Editor (Recommended)">
    - In Cap Studio, just click New Cap
    - Use the form based editor to configure Prompt, Model, MCP servers and UI
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upload a JSON file">
  <Tip>
  This approach is for developers who want to load a cap config from a JSON file.
</Tip>
    - Create a Cap JSON file locally that follows the Cap shape (see [Capabilities](/introduction/core-concepts/capabilities))
    - In Cap Studio, choose Upload/Import JSON to load your file

    Minimal example (cap.json):

    ```json cap.json
    {
      // no need to fill in the id and authorDID, it will be filled in automatically when you upload the json to Cap Studio
      "idName": "my_first_cap",
      "core": {
        "prompt": {
          "value": "You are a helpful assistant. {{user_geo}}",
          "suggestions": ["Summarize this text", "Generate an outline"]
        },
        "model": {
          "providerId": "openrouter",
          "modelId": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
          "supportedInputs": ["text"],
          "contextLength": 128000
        },
        "mcpServers": { "tools": "https://<your-mcp-server>" }
      },
      "metadata": {
        "displayName": "My First Cap",
        "description": "Example Cap built with Nuwa",
        "introduction": "What this Cap does and how to use it...",
        "tags": ["example", "starter"]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>



## Step 3: Publish the Cap

- Click Submit to Store in Cap Studio (applies to both the online editor and uploaded JSON)
- Review metadata, thumbnail, links, and MCP configuration
- Submit; your Cap becomes discoverable in the Cap Store
