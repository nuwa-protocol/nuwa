## What Is Nuwa?

Nuwa is an agent-first AI platform where users pay developers directly for AI models, agents, and tools. It is built on three pillars:

- Capabilities (Caps): the minimum functional AI unit that bundles a Prompt, a Model, and optional MCP tools and UI artifact
- Decentralized Identity (DID): user-owned identity and auth; no central account silos
- Crypto Micropayments: fast, low-friction payments via unidirectional payment channels secured by blockchain

For users: one client for all agents and models. For developers: package what you build as a Cap and get paid directly by users.

## Why Nuwa

Today's internet is app-centric: fragmented, repetitive, and inefficient. Nuwa flips the model to be agent-first and protocol-powered.

- One consistent client and memory across tasks and tools
- No repeated sign-ups or API key juggling - use your DID everywhere
- Built-in monetization for developers through crypto micropayments

## How Nuwa Works

- Caps: Ship your AI capability as a composable bundle (Prompt + Model + MCP servers + optional UI artifact)
- Identity: A single DID with multiple device keys (NIP-1) and DIDAuth v1 for request authentication (NIP-2)
- Payments: Unidirectional payment channels (NIP-4) using Rooch on-chain contracts; requests carry signed receipts for streaming or non-streaming APIs

## Repo At A Glance

- `nuwa-client`: Local-first chat client that runs Caps, handles DID auth, and attaches payment proofs automatically
- `nuwa-kit`: SDKs for building with Nuwa (Identity, Payment, Cap, and UI kits in TypeScript; Python planned)
- `nuwa-services`: Reference services (LLM Gateway, Custodian/CADOP, MCP proxy, indexers)
