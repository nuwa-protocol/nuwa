## Overview

This guide shows how to launch your first Cap using the Nuwa Client (Beta), configure its Model, Prompt, and MCP servers, and publish it to the Cap Store.

<Tip>
  For a deeper dive into how Caps work, see Core Concepts -> Capabilities and the Build Caps section.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Sign in and enable Cap Studio

1) Open the Nuwa Client Beta: https://test-app.nuwa.dev/
2) Create and authenticate your DID with your device passkey
3) Go to Settings and enable Developer Mode
4) You will see Cap Studio in the sidebar

## Step 2: Create a new Cap

There are two ways to create a Cap:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Online Editor (Cap Studio)">
    - In Cap Studio, click New Cap
    - Use the editor to configure Prompt, Model, and MCP servers
    - Use the MCP Tools tab to connect and test your MCP endpoints
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upload a JSON file">
    - Create a Cap JSON file locally that follows the Cap shape (see Core Concepts -> Capabilities)
    - In Cap Studio, choose Upload/Import JSON to load your file
    - Review fields in the editor and continue to publish

    Minimal example (cap.json):

    ```json cap.json
    {
      "idName": "my_first_cap",
      "core": {
        "prompt": {
          "value": "You are a helpful assistant. {{user_geo}}",
          "suggestions": ["Summarize this text", "Generate an outline"]
        },
        "model": {
          "providerId": "openrouter",
          "modelId": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
          "supportedInputs": ["text"],
          "contextLength": 128000
        },
        "mcpServers": { "tools": "https://<your-mcp-server>" }
      },
      "metadata": {
        "displayName": "My First Cap",
        "description": "Example Cap built with Nuwa",
        "introduction": "What this Cap does and how to use it...",
        "tags": ["example", "starter"]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Prefer small, composable Caps. Add MCP servers only when you need external tools, and use an optional artifact UI for richer experiences.
  See Build Caps -> Models/Prompt/MCP and Core Concepts -> Capabilities for details.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Publish the Cap

- Click Submit to Store in Cap Studio (applies to both the online editor and uploaded JSON)
- Review metadata, thumbnail, links, and MCP configuration
- Submit; your Cap becomes discoverable in the Cap Store
