Use this page as the DIDAuth entry point, then pick the integration path that matches your role.

## For Agent Integrations

Use the CLI-first remote flow when users and agents are on different devices:

- [DIDAuth for Remote Agents](/guides/did-auth-agent)

This guide covers:

- local key initialization with `nuwa-id`
- deep link generation on `id.nuwa.dev`
- user DID handoff and local DID binding
- verified DID-authenticated requests

## For Backend Integrations

Use this when your service needs to verify `Authorization: DIDAuthV1 ...`:

- [DIDAuth for Backend Services](/guides/did-auth-server)

This guide covers:

- `IdentityKit.bootstrap()` for DID resolution
- Express middleware with `DIDAuth.v1.verifyAuthHeader()`
- protected routes (`/whoami`) and production notes

## Recommended Order

1. Start with remote agent flow to understand header generation and key binding.
2. Add backend middleware verification to protect APIs.
3. Move to shared nonce store + rate limiting before production rollout.
