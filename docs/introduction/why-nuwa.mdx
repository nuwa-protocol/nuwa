We wan to help developers to monetize their crafted AI services, and we want to help users access all AI capabilities with less friction.

Today's AI is app-centric. If you want AI to help you with something, you have to search for that AI app, sign up, surrender your credit card info, and then you can finally give it a test. Sometimes you find it doesn't entirely fit your need, then you need to move on to the next.

The problem is obvious: 

**Apps, the foundation of our internet service is becoming a barrier to access AI services.**

That's why we think that for AI service, we need Caps, composable AI capabilities that the user can access without any frictions so that we could offer an AI client that helps users to orchestrate their own AI for all AI needs.

The benefits are obvious:

**For users:**
  - One client to discover and use AI functionality across providers.
  - No repeated sign-ups; no monthly subscriptions - use one account for all AIs and pay on demand.

Use GPT or Claude Sonnet in the morning to get work done, then a music composition agent in the afternoon - all in one place.

**For developers:**
  - No need to wrap functionality into a standalone app. Launch a model or MCP as a Cap in seconds and start getting paid.
  - No Stripe fees. You receive 100% of what users pay you, instantly.

If you've built dozens of MCPs, don't let them sit on GitHub - launch them as Caps.
