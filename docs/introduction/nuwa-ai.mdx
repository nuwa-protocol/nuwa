## What Is Nuwa?

Nuwa is an open AI marketplace where users pay developers directly for AI models, agents, and MCP tools. It is built on three pillars:

- **AI Capabilities (Caps):** The smallest functional unit that bundles a Prompt, a Model, and optional MCP tools and UI.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID):** Self-owned identity and auth for both users and Caps.
- **P2P Micropayments:** Fast, low-friction payments based on payment channel and [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org/).

<Note>
  The current payment kit is based on Nuwa's Payment Channel solution. We are working on integrating the **x402 protocol** to make it more flexible and scalable. Check out our demo with [xNUWA](https://xnuwa.app).

## Why Nuwa?

We help developers monetize MCP tools and models, and we help users access AI with less friction.

Today's AI is app-centric. Nuwa flips that model:

**For users:**
  - One client to discover and use AI functionality across providers.
  - No repeated sign-ups; no monthly subscriptions - use one account for all AIs and pay on demand.

Use GPT or Claude Sonnet in the morning to get work done, then a music composition agent in the afternoon - all in one place.

**For developers:**
  - No need to wrap functionality into a standalone app. Launch a model or MCP as a Cap in seconds and start getting paid.
  - No Stripe fees. You receive 100% of what users pay you, instantly.

If you've built dozens of MCPs, don't let them sit on GitHub - launch them as Caps.
