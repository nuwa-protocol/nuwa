## What Is Nuwa AI?

Nuwa AI is building an open community and marketplace for AI Capabilities, where users pay developers directly for AI services, including models, MCPs, UI, Prompt and workflows. It is built on three pillars:

- **[AI Capabilities (Caps)](/introduction/core-concepts/capabilities):** An abstraction of the the AI functional unit that bundles a Prompt, a Model, MCP tools and UI.
- **[Decentralized Identity (DID)](/introduction/core-concepts/identity):** Self-owned identity and auth for both users and Caps.
- **[Crypto P2P Payments](/introduction/core-concepts/payment):** Fast, low-friction payments based on [Nuwa Payment Channel](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/nuwa/tree/main/nuwa-kit/typescript/packages/payment-kit) and [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org/).
