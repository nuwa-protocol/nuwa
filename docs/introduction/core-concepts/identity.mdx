## Overview

Identity in Nuwa is based on the [W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/). Both users and Caps are identified by unique DIDs, which can be binded with a set of cryptographic private keys.


## Basic Usage With Identity Kit

```ts
import { IdentityKit, DIDAuth, KeyType } from '@nuwa-ai/identity-kit';

// Bootstrap environment (register VDRs, create KeyManager & KeyStore)
const env = await IdentityKit.bootstrap({
  method: 'rooch',
  vdrOptions: { rpcUrl: 'https://test-seed.rooch.network' },
});

// Load or create a DID (shortened)
const kit = await env.loadDid('did:rooch:0xYourDid');

// Sign a DIDAuth v1 payload
const sig = await DIDAuth.v1.createSignature(
  { operation: 'example', params: { message: 'hello' } },
  env.keyManager,
  kit.getDIDDocument().verificationMethod![0].id
);

// Convert to Authorization header value
const header = DIDAuth.v1.toAuthorizationHeader(sig);
// -> pass `header` as `Authorization: DIDAuthV1 <...>` when calling services
```

## Onboarding (CADOP)

For onboarding the users and developers, we provide a custodian service called CADOP to help you mint a DID with a device passkey.

- As users, you will login to the Nuwa Client with a device passkey, which will mint a User DID for you.
- As developers, you can also mint a service DID key with a device passkey or simply provide a private key to identify your service for receiving payment.

The CADOP service will help to relay on-chain transactions and cover gas for first-time users.
