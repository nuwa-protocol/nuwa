xNUWA is Nuwa's x402-native AI client that demonstrates how users and autonomous agents can browse, pay for, and run AI Agents with nothing more than an on-device wallet. The app lives at [xnuwa.app](https://xnuwa.app) and is open-sourced at [`nuwa-protocol/xnuwa.app`](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/xnuwa.app).

> Agents bundle a prompt, model (or remote API), optional MCP tools, and a UI surface. xNUWA renders these agents, handles payment auth, and records usage so builders can monetize instantly.


<Tip>xNUWA is currently in alpha. For developers, xNUWA is the fastest way to feel the x402 flow from the client perspectiveâ€”use it to test your own paid MCP, validate facilitator compatibility, and demo the experience to end users. .</Tip>

## Key Features

- **Self-custodied identity:** Users authenticate with an EVM address. Keys are stored client-side (IndexedDB) and decrypted only when signing with a PIN or passkey.
- **Seamless x402 checkout:** Every paid MCP call or LLM request goes through x402 receipts. The client handles the `X-PAYMENT` negotiation flow automatically.
- **Offline-friendly data model:** Zustand + Dexie keep chat history, wallet metadata, and agent configs available even without a persistent backend.
- **Registry integration:** Ships with a community `agent-registry/` for publishing reusable agents that comply with the Nuwa Agent registration schema.

## How payments work inside xNUWA

1. The MCP or LLM endpoint replies with `402 Payment Required` plus the x402 `paymentRequirements` payload.
2. xNUWA selects a supported scheme/network (default: `exact` on `base-sepolia`) and builds the `X-PAYMENT` header, signing the transaction via the embedded wallet.
3. The client resends the request with `X-PAYMENT`; the endpoint verifies/settles (often via Coinbase facilitator) and responds with `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` for observability.
4. Receipts are persisted locally so users can audit spend and quickly replay flows without reconfiguration.

<Note>
  You can connect xNUWA to mainnet by switching the default network to `base` once your service wallet is funded with USDC.

## What Is ERC8004?

ERC8004 is an emerging on-chain registry standard for publishing and discovering off-chain AI services and agents. In practice, it maps an on-chain identity to verifiable service metadata (e.g., endpoints, content identifiers, and ownership), so wallets and clients like xNUWA can resolve and load agents in a permissionless way.

- xNUWA reads ERC8004 records to discover and load agents alongside its local `agent-registry/`.
- Builders can register their agents to an ERC8004 registry to make them globally discoverable.
- See the Nuwa reference implementation: https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/nuwa-8004/tree/main

## Best practices for builders

- **Bundle demos:** Include a demo agent and sample MCP configs so new users can verify payments quickly.
- **Respect privacy:** Keep sensitive data in encrypted Zustand stores and avoid exporting private keys.
- **Document agents:** Maintain markdown docs inside `agent-registry/` and link back to your repos via the `metadata` block.
- **Monitor receipts:** Surface `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` details in your agent UI so developers can debug facilitator or settlement issues fast.
