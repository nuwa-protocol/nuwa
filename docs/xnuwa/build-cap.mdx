## Flow overview

2. [Build and Test Cap](#2-build-and-test-your-cap)
3. [Export the Cap YAML](#3-add-the-manifest-to-cap-registry)
4. [Make a PR to Submit Demo.](#4-submit-a-pull-request)

## 1. Clone & bootstrap the workspace

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/xnuwa.app.git
cd xnuwa.app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This launches the Nuwa Client (including Cap Studio) at `http://localhost:5173`. Create your wallet with a PIN (with) a passkey.

<Tip>
  We have a built-in demo with a paid mcp and a paid LLM. you can find the open source code in the [`nuwa-x402` repo](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/nuwa-x402).
</Tip>

## 2. Build and test your Cap
- In the sidebar, go to **Settings -> System -> Enable Developer Mode**, your sidebar will now have a new **Cap Studio** entrance.
- Create a new Cap with **Cap Studio â†’ New Cap** button, or use the **Import YAML option** to load the demo cap yaml file from the `cap-registry` folder
- Configure the Cap with the form based editor, you can set the Prompt, Model, MCP servers and UI. Find the relevant information in the [Nuwa AI](../build-caps/quickstart) docs.
- You can test your paid MCP with the **MCP Debug Tool** in the Cap Studio.
- Use **Test Cap** to test your cap.


## 3. Add Cap YAML to `cap-registry/`

When you are satisfied with your Cap, click menu and **Export YAML** to export the Cap YAML file into the `cap-registry` folder in the project root. And restart the dev server.

The xNUWA is configure to auto load Cap files from the `cap-registry` folder. You can find your new caps by switching caps in the prompt input.

## 4. Submit a pull request

If you want others to try your cap via our hosted [xNUWA app](https://xnuwa.app), you can make a PR to submit your cap to our repo.

Create a feature branch and commit your Cap:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/add-my-first-cap
git add cap-registry/my_first_cap.yaml
git commit -m "Add My First Cap to registry"
git push origin feat/add-my-first-cap
```

Then give us a summary on what you wanna show with your cap in your PR. The github bot will check your Cap Schema. We will merge your PR asap.
