title: "What is x402?"
description: "Learn how the x402 payments protocol activates HTTP 402 for instant, web-native crypto payments."
---

x402 is an open, HTTP-native payment standard maintained by the Coinbase Developer Platform. It activates the long-dormant `402 Payment Required` status so any API, website, or agent can charge small crypto-denominated fees without building custom billing flows.   
The V1 specification focuses on flat-rate micropayments using the **`X-PAYMENT`** header and a standard JSON schema for negotiating payment requirements between clients, resource servers, and facilitators.

## Why x402 matters

- **Open standard, no rent seeking:** The protocol is stewarded in the open, and implementations (client, server, facilitator) can be built by anyone. [(coinbase/x402)](https://github.com/coinbase/x402)
- **HTTP-native integration:** Payments ride on ordinary HTTP requests and responses—no extra sign-in, OAuth, or signature exchanges. [(x402.org)](https://x402.org)
- **Chain & asset agnostic:** Any `(scheme, network)` pair can be registered so you can settle on Base, L2s, or other chains that meet the spec.
- **Trust-minimized settlement:** Resource servers never take custody of user funds; a facilitator verifies receipts on-chain and can optionally settle on the server’s behalf.
- **Agent-friendly micropayments:** Fees can be as low as $0.001 with ~2 second settlement, enabling AI agents and bots to pay per-request.

## Core roles in the ecosystem

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **Client** | Requests a protected resource and composes `X-PAYMENT` payloads. |
| **Resource server** | Exposes the API/content and responds with `402` when payment is required. |
| **Facilitator server** | Optional third party that verifies and settles payments so the resource server does not need direct chain access. |

## Schemes & networks

- **Schemes** describe *how* value is moved. The first shipping scheme is `exact`, which transfers a fixed amount (e.g., “pay $0.01 for this request”). Future schemes like `upto` add metered usage.
- **Networks** scope those schemes to a blockchain implementation (for example, `exact` on Base differs from `exact` on Solana). Clients, facilitators, and servers must explicitly agree on the `(scheme, network)` pair.

> x402 is built to be extensible: see [`specs/schemes`](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/specs/schemes) for latest proposals, and [`ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for upcoming protocol milestones.
