## Overview

Nuwa Kit is the developer toolkit for building on the Nuwa protocol. It includes TypeScript SDKs for identity (DID), payments (channels), capability packaging (Caps), and UI integration.

Packages (TypeScript):

- `@nuwa-ai/identity-kit`: DID creation, resolution, and DIDAuth v1
- `@nuwa-ai/payment-kit`: unidirectional payment channels (HTTP + MCP), strategies, streaming
- `@nuwa-ai/cap-kit`: register, discover, and manage Caps
- `@nuwa-ai/ui-kit`: iframe UI integration and MCP postMessage transport

Python SDKs are planned.

```bash
pnpm add @nuwa-ai/identity-kit @nuwa-ai/payment-kit @nuwa-ai/cap-kit @nuwa-ai/ui-kit
