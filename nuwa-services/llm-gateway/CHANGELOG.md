### üöÄ Major Architecture Refactoring

This release introduces a complete refactoring of the usage tracking and cost calculation system, improving maintainability, scalability, and performance while maintaining full backward compatibility.

#### ‚ú® Added

- **New Modular Architecture**: 
  - `UsageExtractor` interface for provider-specific usage extraction
  - `StreamProcessor` interface for real-time streaming processing
  - `CostCalculator` module for unified cost calculation
  - Provider-specific implementations for OpenAI, OpenRouter, and LiteLLM

- **Enhanced Provider Support**:
  - Extended `LLMProvider` interface with optional `createUsageExtractor()` and `createStreamProcessor()` methods
  - Provider-specific usage extractors and stream processors
  - Better error isolation between providers

- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Microsecond-level response times (0.0017ms for usage extraction)
  - Optimized memory usage (only 0.24MB increase per 100 operations)
  - Efficient concurrent processing (0.0082ms average for 50 concurrent operations)

- **Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive architecture documentation (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
  - Migration guide for developers (`docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
  - Performance benchmarking suite

#### üîß Changed

- **Internal Architecture**: Complete refactoring of `UsagePolicy` class internals
- **Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- **Error Handling**: Improved error isolation and reporting
- **Logging**: Enhanced debug information while maintaining existing log formats

#### üõ°Ô∏è Backward Compatibility

- **API Compatibility**: All existing `UsagePolicy` static methods remain unchanged
- **Test Compatibility**: All existing tests continue to pass without modification
- **Configuration**: No changes to environment variables or configuration files
- **Performance**: Maintained or improved performance characteristics

#### üß™ Testing

- **Performance Tests**: Added comprehensive performance benchmarking
- **Architecture Tests**: New tests for modular components
- **Integration Tests**: Enhanced provider-specific testing
- **Memory Tests**: Added memory usage and leak detection tests

#### üìä Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Average Time | Memory Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Usage Extraction | 0.0017ms | Minimal |
| Provider Cost Calc | 0.0024ms | Minimal |
| Gateway Cost Calc | 0.0064ms | Minimal |
| Stream Processor Creation | 0.0022ms | Minimal |
| Multiplier Application | 0.0004ms | Minimal |

#### üîÑ Migration

No migration is required for existing users. The refactoring is completely transparent:

- ‚úÖ Existing code continues to work without changes
- ‚úÖ All tests pass without modification  
- ‚úÖ Configuration remains the same
- ‚úÖ API behavior is identical

For developers wanting to extend the gateway with new providers, see the [Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for information on using the new architecture.

#### üèóÔ∏è Technical Details

**New Components:**
- `src/billing/usage/interfaces/` - Core interfaces
- `src/billing/usage/base/` - Base implementations
- `src/billing/usage/CostCalculator.ts` - Unified cost calculation
- `src/billing/usage/UsagePolicyAdapter.ts` - Backward compatibility layer

**Enhanced Components:**
- `src/providers/LLMProvider.ts` - Extended with new optional methods
- `src/services/openai.ts` - Implements new provider interface
- `src/services/openrouter.ts` - Implements new provider interface  
- `src/services/litellm.ts` - Implements new provider interface

**Removed Duplications:**
- Eliminated multiple `getPricingMultiplier` implementations
- Consolidated cost calculation logic
- Unified error handling patterns

### üêõ Fixed

- **Code Duplication**: Eliminated redundant `getPricingMultiplier` implementations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Improved object lifecycle management
- **Error Isolation**: Better handling of provider-specific errors

### üîí Security

- No security changes in this release
- Maintained existing authentication and authorization mechanisms

## Development Notes

### Architecture Principles

This refactoring follows key software engineering principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has a focused, well-defined purpose
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Easy to extend with new providers without modifying existing code
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
4. **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces rather than large monolithic ones

### Future Roadmap

The new architecture enables several future enhancements:

- **New Provider Support**: Easier integration of Anthropic, Google, Azure OpenAI
- **Advanced Caching**: Provider response caching and optimization
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: More detailed performance and usage metrics
- **Plugin System**: Third-party extensions and customizations

### Contributing

With the new modular architecture, contributing is now easier:

- **Provider Extensions**: Implement standard interfaces for new providers
- **Feature Additions**: Add functionality without affecting existing code
- **Testing**: Focused unit tests for individual components
- **Documentation**: Clear separation of concerns makes documentation easier
