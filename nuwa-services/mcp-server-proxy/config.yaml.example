  # You can add more upstreams here, for example, an HTTP-based one:
  # amap:
  #   type: "http"
  #   url: "https://mcp.amap.com/mcp?key=${AMAP_API_KEY}"
  #   auth:
  #     ...

# Routing rules

  # Route requests with hostnames starting with "context7." to the context7 upstream.

    upstream: "context7"

  # Route requests for "amap." to the amap upstream.
  # - hostname: "amap."
