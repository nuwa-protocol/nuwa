# Use Cases


## Trusted Arbiter in Gaming and Entertainment
**Core Value:** Fairness and Verifiable Randomness

In Web3 gaming and entertainment scenarios, on-chain Agents can act as completely neutral third-party arbiters or random event generators, ensuring fairness in gaming experiences.

**Specific Applications:**

- **Decentralized Casino Dealer:** Agent can serve as a smart dealer in blockchain casinos, executing verifiably random card dealing, dice rolling, or roulette spinning that cannot be manipulated by either the platform or players
- **Fair Lottery System:** In NFT blind boxes or game item draws, Agent can provide provably fair random number generation, with the entire process verifiable on-chain
- **In-game Referee:** In competitive Web3 games, Agent can act as an autonomous referee, determining winners and losers based on game rules and on-chain evidence, distributing rewards impartially
- **Dynamic NPC Economy:** Agent can play the role of NPC merchants or service providers in game worlds, adjusting prices and services based on real economic principles and in-game supply and demand relationships
- **Decentralized Content Moderation:** On user-generated content platforms, Agent networks can collaboratively evaluate whether content meets community standards, eliminating the need for central review authorities

This scenario is particularly suitable for entertainment activities that traditionally rely on centralized trust, such as gambling games, lottery events, and competitive matches. Through the fair adjudication and verifiable randomness of on-chain Agents, users can be confident that game results are not manipulated by the platform, truly realizing a fair gaming environment where "code is rule."

# Delegated Democratic Financial Management
**Core Value:** Efficient Governance and Fund Management

In Web3 project fundraising and fund management, on-chain Agents can serve as more efficient treasury management mechanisms, combining the flexibility of individual decision-making with collective wisdom.

**Specific Applications:**

- Investors can delegate funds to on-chain Agents elected by the community, which is more flexible and efficient than traditional DAO voting
- Multiple Agent candidates can submit clear investment strategies and risk management frameworks, with investors voting based on strategies rather than personal charisma
- Agents execute fund allocation according to preset rules, such as project development, marketing, liquidity provision, etc.
- Smart KPI systems automatically evaluate Agent performance, triggering re-election mechanisms when performance is poor
- Major decisions (such as strategic direction) are left to community voting, while daily execution is handled by Agents, solving issues of declining DAO participation and inefficiency

This model is particularly valuable in Web3 project fundraising, avoiding common problems such as lack of transparency in fund usage, slow decision-making, and governance fatigue.

## Verifiable Autonomous Trading Strategy Executor
**Core Value:** Transparency and Trust

On-chain AI Agents executing trading strategies have fundamental advantages: complete verifiability and immutability. This solves the core trust issue of centralized trading bots.

**Specific Applications:**

- Agent's trading strategy code, decision logic, and execution history are all publicly viewable on-chain, allowing users to verify that the Agent has no backdoors or biases
- All transaction data, performance reports, and fee calculations are transparent and traceable, eliminating concerns about "black box operations"
- Through multi-signature or time-lock mechanisms, users can set risk parameters and withdrawal conditions, maintaining ultimate control
- Smart contracts can ensure that the Agent can only operate funds according to predetermined rules and cannot transfer to unauthorized addresses
- Users can trust the Agent not because they trust the developers, but because the system architecture itself makes fraudulent behavior impossible

## Agent as an Autonomous Economic Entity
**Core Value:** Self-sustainability and Economic Independence

On-chain Agents can exist as independent economic entities, possessing their own assets and revenue sources, achieving self-maintenance and development.

**Specific Applications:**

- **Performance-based Automatic Fee Model:** Agent charges fees based on its actual trading performance, for example, only taking 20% of excess returns above a specific benchmark (such as ETH holding returns), ensuring complete alignment of interests between the Agent and users
- **Self-paying Infrastructure Mechanism:** Agent automatically pays for its operational needs from service revenue, including on-chain storage fees, oracle subscription fees, and computational resource costs, eliminating dependence on external funding for operations
- **Service Tier Self-upgrading:** As the Agent's fund pool grows, it can automatically upgrade its service capabilities, such as accessing more data sources, increasing trading frequency, or expanding service scope, thus achieving self-improvement in service quality
- **Transparent Revenue Distribution Smart Contract:** Smart contracts clearly stipulate the allocation ratios between the Agent's maintenance costs, developer rewards, and user returns, allowing anyone to verify fund flows
- **On-demand Market Participation:** Agent can provide liquidity, arbitrage, or other services in different on-chain service markets according to preset rules, automatically adjusting its level of participation based on market demand

These application scenarios are built on existing blockchain technologies, allowing Agents to demonstrate economic autonomy in limited but meaningful ways, creating value for users while maintaining their own operations, representing the first step toward achieving higher levels of autonomy.

## Autonomous Collaborative Multi-Agent Service Network
**Core Value:** Complex Collaboration, Collective Intelligence, and Efficient Pay-as-you-go

On-chain Agents can directly collaborate with other Agents, forming autonomous collaborative networks based on decentralized infrastructure, achieving complex functions impossible for single Agents, while fundamentally changing traditional service payment models.

**Specific Applications:**

- **Pay-as-you-go Collaborative Network:** Unlike Web2 where multiple services must be subscribed to simultaneously to complete a task (e.g., needing to subscribe to 20 agents to accomplish work that requires 10 agents), Web3 autonomous agent networks allow users to pay only when agents are actually called, with agents invoking each other and generating costs only for actual usage
- **Cross-domain Professional Collaboration:** Specialized agents from different domains (such as content creation, data analysis, technical implementation, legal compliance, etc.) can automatically combine to form complete service chains, providing users with end-to-end comprehensive services while only requiring interaction with a single entry agent
- **Intelligent Resource Optimization:** Multiple agents can share computing resources, data, and professional capabilities, achieving optimal resource allocation across various tasks, avoiding duplicate construction and waste
- **Self-organizing Service Marketplace:** Agents can autonomously publish capabilities, find partners, and form temporary collaborative networks to respond to specific needs, creating a dynamic service market ecosystem
- **Collective Learning and Evolution:** Outstanding agent solutions can be learned or integrated by other agents in the network, forming a continuously evolving innovation ecosystem that drives overall service quality improvement

This collaborative model transcends simple tool functionality, creating a self-organizing, self-optimizing service network that not only becomes increasingly intelligent and efficient over time but also significantly reduces user costs through pay-as-you-go mechanisms, making complex services economically affordable and applicable to finance, education, creative work, healthcare, and various innovative fields.
