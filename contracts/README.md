# Nuwa Protocol Smart Contracts

This directory is intended to house the smart contracts that form the core on-chain backbone of the Nuwa Protocol. These contracts are responsible for defining and managing the fundamental logic, state, and interactions within the Nuwa ecosystem.

## Overview

The Nuwa Protocol relies on smart contracts to enable a decentralized and autonomous agent network. Key functionalities managed by these contracts include (but are not limited to):

*   **Agent Identity (DID):** Registration, management, and verification of decentralized identifiers for AI agents.
*   **Service Registration:** On-chain registry for AI services, oracles, and other essential components.
*   **Protocol Governance:** Mechanisms for protocol upgrades and parameter adjustments (as defined in NIPs).
*   **Value Exchange:** Handling of incentives, payments, or staking related to tasks and services.
