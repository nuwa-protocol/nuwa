**Caps** are modular units of functionality callable by agents, defined using the Agent Capability Protocol (ACP). They replace traditional app interfaces with composable service endpoints. Each Cap represents a discrete skill or function that agents can install, execute, and remove dynamically.

#### Cap Components

Caps are described through `.acp.yaml` files that contain:

- A **JSON schema** specifying expected inputs, outputs, and state structures.
- A **system prompt** guiding the LLM on how to use the capability.
- A **tool manifest** for runtime invocation.
- Metadata including ID, permissions, triggers, and compatibility.

#### Cap Lifecycle

Caps can be registered in a decentralized registry and discovered by agents at runtime. Users can:

- **Install** new capabilities on demand.
- **Compose** multiple Caps for complex workflows.
- **Update** or **remove** them without affecting global agent behavior.
