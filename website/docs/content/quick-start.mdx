With the launch of the Nuwa AI Beta, you can now easily launch a Cap with the Nuwa Client.

Currently the Cap configuration is not fully implemented. At its core, there are 3 parts that you can configure:
- Model
- Prompt
- MCP Servers

This docs will walk you through the process of launching a Cap with the Nuwa Client, and how to configure each part.

## Launch a Cap with Cap Studio
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Steps>
### Go to the Cap Studio
 
Log into the Nuwa AI Beta: https://test-app.nuwa.dev/ by creating and authenticating your DID acount with your device passkey.

Once you are logged in, you can navigate to the settings page, and turn on the Developer Mode. Then you will see the Cap Studio button in the sidebar.

The Cap Studio provides a simple dashboard for editing, testing and launching your Cap. There's an MCP tools for your to test out your MCP servers.

To start a new Cap, click on the "New Cap" button in the Cap Studio.

### Model Configuration

Choose a LLM Model from the list of models.

<Callout type="info">So far you can only choose from a list of supported models. These models are served by Openrouter. We have built a [Nuwa LLM Gateway proxy](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/nuwa/tree/main/nuwa-services/llm-gateway) to enable these models with DID identity authentication as well as payments. <br /> We will soon support custom models for Cap by providing you with [Nuwa Kit](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/nuwa/tree/main/nuwa-kit).</Callout>

### Prompt Configuration
You can configure a public prompt for your cap in the Prompt Configuration section.

![Nuwa AI Beta Quick Start 4](/docs/quick-start-4.png)

The prompt will be used as the system instruction for your Cap, and will be sent to the Model as the first system message.

You can also choose to include **Prompt Variables** in your prompt. These variables will be replaced with the actual values when the Cap is launched in the user's client.

Prompt Suggestions are the questions that will be shown to the user when they are selecting your Cap. Configure them to help the user understand your Cap better.

### Configure the MCP Servers

You can configure the MCP servers for your Cap in the MCP Servers Configuration section.

![Nuwa AI Beta Quick Start 6](/docs/quick-start-6.png)

You can add multiple MCP servers to your Cap. All tools from your MCP servers will be added available to your Model when the user sends requests.

Each MCP server contains:
* **Server Name** - a unique name to identify the MCP server
* **Server URL** - the URL of the MCP server
* **Transport** - Currently only SSE and HTTP Streamable are supported.


<Callout type="info">You can choose to customize a MCP server with Nuwa Kit by adding the DID authentication. See the [Nuwa AI MCP Server Example](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/nuwa/tree/main/nuwa-kit/typescript/examples/mcp-server). <br /> Or you can choose to use an existing MCP server and use a [Nuwa compatible MCP Proxy](https://github.com/nuwa-protocol/nuwa/tree/main/nuwa-services/mcp-server-proxy) to enable DID authentication before the requests reach the MCP server. <br /> Please note that the MCP payment is not supported yet We will soon support it and provide a more detailed guide.</Callout>



### Publish the Cap

Once you have configured the Cap, you can click on the "Submit for Publishing" button to publish your Cap.
