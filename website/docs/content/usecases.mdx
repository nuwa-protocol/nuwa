Nuwa enables AI agents to interact with digital services on your behalf — executing multi-step tasks that would otherwise require context switching, repeated inputs, and manual coordination.

Traditional app workflows force users to act as the glue between services. Nuwa shifts this paradigm by empowering agents to compose and execute capabilities (Caps) across tools and APIs, using natural language as the interface and agents as the operator.

Below is a walkthrough of one typical workflow.

### 🧠 Research & Planning: AI Conference Travel Assistant

#### Current Workflow (Without Nuwa)

A user looking to attend an AI conference typically needs to:

1. Search for relevant events on Google or Eventbrite;
2. Visit multiple event websites to collect details (date, location, ticket info);
3. Manually compare options and check calendar for conflicts;
4. Book flights and hotels via travel platforms, re-entering personal details repeatedly;
5. Save confirmation emails and invoices manually for reimbursement.

This workflow involves at least **5 different apps or websites**, and the user has to manually manage all context across them. Even with some of them powered by AI agents, the workflow is still fragmented and requires manual coordination.

#### Seamless Workflow with Nuwa

The user simply says:  
**"Find upcoming AI conferences next quarter and help me plan the trip."**

Nuwa Agent will:

1. Call `ConferenceSearchCap` to discover events;
2. Use `ContentSummarizerCap` to extract key details and compare options;
3. Cross-check schedules using `CalendarCap` and propose suitable dates;
4. Book travel with `FlightBookingCap` and `HotelBookingCap`;
5. Store all receipts using `ReceiptCollectorCap` for future reimbursement.

🔁 **No app switching, no repeated input — the agent handles everything end-to-end.**
